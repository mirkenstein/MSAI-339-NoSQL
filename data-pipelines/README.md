# Data Pipelines Setup 
For logstash pipeline see the [Logstash](./Logstash/README.md) folder where we have detailed instructions on running 
a pipeline 
via docker image

We will also introduce a visual pipeline tool Streamsets.
In order to use it we will need to signup for free account at https://cloud.login.streamsets.com/login
